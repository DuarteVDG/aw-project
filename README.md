## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive blueprint for a mobile app, which will be responsible for providing all the architectural decisions required to build the app, given the app prototype. The blueprint covers the following aspects of the app:
- Front-end: Micro-frontends + View components + FE services + FE orchestration
- Back-end: BE services (microservices) + resource management + APIs (OpenAPI)
- Integration: JSON objects (OpenAPI)

## Project Focus:
The project is focused on architectural issues, including systems architecture, software architecture, and app architecture. 

## Timeline:
### Frontend
- **Week 1:** Splitting the app into micro-frontends and defining the responsibility for each of the micro-frontends.
- **Week 2:** Defining the views (presentation) and FE services for each micro-frontend.
- **Week 3:** For each view: defining required components, with a special focus on reusability.
              For each top component: defining required ViewModels, variables that configure rendering, variables that define context and state variables.
              Connecting everything: micro-frontends, views, components, ViewModels and FE services.
- **Week 4:** Defining the story space, both using top-down and bottom-up approaches.
  
### Note:
The project has a technical nature but is not code-oriented.
