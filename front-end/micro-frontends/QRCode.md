# `QR Code` Micro-Frontend

## Description

The `QR Code` micro-frontend provides functionality for detecting meat products through the use of QR code scanning within the application.

## Justification
- **Simplicity and Single Responsibility:** The QR Code System micro-frontend has the sole responsibility of scanning QR codes, ensuring a focused and clear purpose.
- **Reusability:** This micro-frontend system can be easily implemented in various parts of the app where QR code scanning is needed, promoting consistency and reducing development effort.
- **Autonomous Teams and Independent Deployment:** The team responsible for this micro-frontend system operates autonomously, without dependencies from the rest of the app development team, facilitating development and maintenance.

## Responsabilities
- Implement QR code scanning functionality.
- Detect meat products through scanned QR codes.

## Consequences and Implications
- **Positive:** Enhances user experience by allowing easy and quick access to detailed information about meat products.
- **Negative:** May require integration with external databases or services for accurate product information retrieval. However, this integration can enhance the functionality and value of the application.
