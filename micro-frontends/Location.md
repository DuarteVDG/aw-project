# `Location` Micro-Frontend

## Description

The `Location` micro-frontend is a micro-frontend dedicated to the selection of supermarket locations and the display of their geographical location through the use of Google Maps integration.

## Justification
- **Simplicity and Single Responsability:** This micro-frontend is solely dedicated to enabling users to select supermarket locations, and then displaying their corresponding geographical location.
- **Autonomous Teams and Independent Deployment:** The creation of a team exclusively dedicated to developing and maintaining this micro-frontend will enhance the app development efforts, minimizing downtime.

## Responsabilities
- Provides users with the ability to browse and select available supermarket locations (eventually, based on their preferences or geographic location).
- Displays user selected supermarket geographical locations in a Google maps window.

## Consequences and Implications
- **Positive:** Enhances user experience by providing easy supermarket location selection and increases user engagement with map display.
- **Negative:** Reliance on external services (namely, Google Maps API) may introduce dependencies.
